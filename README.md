What is dhcp?

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used to automate the process of configuring devices on IP networks, thus allowing them to use network services such as DNS, NTP, and any communication protocol based on UDP or TCP. A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. DHCP is an enhancement of an older protocol called BOOTP. DHCP is an important part of the DDI solution (DNS-DHCP-IPAM).
